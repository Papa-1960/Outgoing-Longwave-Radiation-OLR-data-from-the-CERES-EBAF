# Outgoing-Longwave-Radiation-OLR-data-from-the-CERES-EBAF
The dataset spans from March 2000 to April 2014 and is stored in a NetCDF file named 'rlut_CERES-EBAF_L3B_Ed2-8_200003-201404.nc'. The code performs data loading, processing, and visualization to compare the annual mean OLR time series in two geographical regions.
# Overall Goal: The code aims to:
Load OLR data from the CERES EBAF dataset.
Extract the rlut variable representing OLR.
Select two geographical regions based on latitude and longitude.
Calculate the annual mean OLR for each region over the period 2000â€“2014.
Plot these time series to compare OLR trends or variations between the two areas.
Outcome: A visual comparison of how annual mean OLR changes over time in two distinct regions, likely to study climate patterns or differences in radiative fluxes.
